# Wisteria Roadmap

Welcome to Wisteria!

This is still very much a beta project, so feel free to 
create issues in this repo or find @mlteal on the WP core 
Slack with any questions, comments, etc. 

To run the app on the frontend, include the 
following shortcode anywhere on the page, using the 
term ID for the roadmap you'd like to display: 

```html
[wrm_roadmap roadmap_id="{roadmap_id}"]
```

Note: only one roadmap can be displayed per page.

After adding the HTML somewhere in your app, here are some 
basics to get you started: 

- (Future Feature) To add an item, double-click in the 
  location you'd like to add to and complete the form that 
  pops up.
- Right click on an item to delete it. Be sure to confirm 
  when the confirmation box appears.
- Scrolling with your cursor within the roadmap bouandries 
  will zoom in or out.
